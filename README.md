# Project Sit On Chair - used techniques - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Project made from psd file, it was my very first project made after only one week of learning HTML + CSS.
It is very simple, but then it looked a little tricky. It does not include RWD. After some time I also added a few things written in JS.
